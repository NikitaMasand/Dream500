Given n coins for two players playing a game. Each player can pick at least 1 and at most 5 coins in one turn.
The player who picks the last coin loses the game. If they play optimally, which player will win the game?

First let me give one similar instance of the above problem:
Problem : Initially the value of n is 0. Now the two players can alternatively
add atleast 1 and atmost 10 to n so as to change the value of n. suppose I start the game
and add k to n such that n becomes n+k∈[n+1,n+10]. Then the second player repeat the procedure and so on….
The guy who is able to make n=100 wins the game.

Strategy to win the game everytime( if you start):
In order to call 100 you must be able to call 89 which in turn requires you to be able to call 78 and so on…
So backtracking gives you a series of winning call as:

1,12,23,34,45,56,67,78,89,100

if you are able to call 1 then you will be able to call 100 and hence win the game.

Try this with your friend. If he/she doesn’t know the logic
then you could let him/her start the game and you could mess around with the series so as to distract him/her out of the logic,
finally you need to call 89.

Now coming to the asked problem:

In order to win, you must be able to leave 1 coin at the table
which in turn requires you to leave 7 coins at the table
which in turn requires you to be able to leave 13 coins on the table and so on…

similar backtracking will give you a series of winning moves as:

1,7,13,19,25,31,37,43,………….6∗k+1

k≥0,k∈N

So if (Number of coins - 1) is a multiple of 6 ,
the person who starts the game is looser because other guy by default is within the series.

Otherwise the person who starts the game is winner.

Consider one example.
Let no.ofcoins=9 .
9–1=8 is not a multiple of 6
hence the person who starts the game wins the game because the starter can remove 1 coin to achieve 7 which is in the series.

I am not sure, but atleast a, atmost b
then (a+b)*k + 1 works
