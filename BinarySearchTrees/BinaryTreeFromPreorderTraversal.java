/*
The trick is to set a range {min .. max} for every node. Initialize the range as {INT_MIN .. INT_MAX}.
The first node will definitely be in range, so create root node. To construct the left subtree, set the range as {INT_MIN â€¦root->data}.
If a values is in the range {INT_MIN .. root->data}, the values is part part of left subtree. To construct the right subtree,
set the range as {root->data..max .. INT_MAX}.

//there was a need to make index class and not directly pass index as int
//because in reucrsion stack if you want to add 7 to tree and thus to call from 1 where index passed was 3,
// but the conditions were not satisfied so you went back to 5, 5's right. but when you went back to 5,
//the index is again 2. but 7's index was 3. how do you keep track of the correct index because
//in the recursion the index goes on going up and down. thus class was made for making index as stable and correct.

Try making a recursion stack if thatâ€™s unclear.
