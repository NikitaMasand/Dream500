//Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s of a given array to the end of the array
/*
if the current element traversed by j is positive, it is swapped with itself. 
else if it is 0, nothing is done and j is incremented, however i now points to that 0.
Then once j finds a positive number, it swaps with i element as i is pointing to 0
swapping takes it behind. 
see the code and take a working example it will make explanation better

One other approach can be by maintaining the count variable which is number of nonzero elements
once whatever is the value of count currently, should be the place of the element at time 
assuming 1 based indexing
for eg: 1,2,0,4,3,0,5,0
1: count = 1 
2: count = 2
0: count = 2
4: count = 3, thus arr[3] = 4, 1,2,4,4,3,0,5,0 
3: count = 4, thus arr[4] = 3  1,2,4,3,3,0,5,0
0: count = 4
5: count = 5, thus arr[5] = 5  1,2,4,3,5,0,5,0
0: count = 5
from i = count, i<n 
replace all elements with 0:
i.e 1,2,4,3,5,0,0,0
